# AYady Non-Monetary Donation Website
AYady is an application for an NGO (non-government organization) that will help donors and anyone requesting a donation reach each other. This application will facilitate communication between both of them. It will be able to provide donations that do not include money such as clothes, medical supplies, school supplies, furniture, toys, etc.. to those who need them.

> **Note**
> This is just the front-end of an online donations system. This is intended to just showcase the UI, UX of the system and not the actual backend. Thus all of the actions do not really do anything in the backend.
